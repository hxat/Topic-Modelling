# Unsupervised Learning solution for Topic Modelling of Tweet on Twitter
This repository contains the code and documentation for my thesis on Unsupervised Learning solution for Topic Modelling of Tweet on Twitter. The purpose of this thesis is to explore unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and analyzing large volumes of tweets on Twitter, with the goal of identifying and extracting meaningful topics from the tweets.

# Motivation
Twitter is a popular social media platform where users can share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences in real-time. With millions of tweets being posted every day, it can be challenging to make sense of all the information and extract meaningful insights from it. Topic modelling is a powerful technique that can help to address this challenge by identifying latent topics in large volumes of text data, such as tweets. However, existing topic modelling techniques often require a large amount of labeled training data, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain for Twitter data. This motivates the need for unsupervised learning solutions for topic modelling of tweets on Twitter.

# Approach
In this thesis, we explore the use of unsupervised learning techniques for topic modelling of tweets on Twitter. Specifically, we focus on clustering techniques such as K-means and Hierarchical clustering to group similar tweets together based on their content. We also use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) techniques to extract topics from the clusters of tweets. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approach using various metrics such as coherence score and silhouette score.

# Repository Contents
This repository contains the following:

code/: a directory containing the Python scripts used for preprocessing the tweet data, running the clustering and topic modelling algorithms, and evaluating the results.
data/: a directory containing the tweet data used for the experiments.
docs/: a directory containing the documentation for the code and the experiments.
README.md: this file.
Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow the instructions in the docs/ directory. The documentation provides a step-by-step guide for running the preprocessing, clustering, and topic modelling scripts, as well as evaluating the results.

# Conclusion
This thesis presents an unsupervised learning approach for topic modelling of tweets on Twitter. The results of our experiments show that our approach can effectively extract meaningful topics from large volumes of tweet data. Our approach can be used for various applications such as social media monitoring, sentiment analysis, and trend analysis.
